I'm new to minecraft and don't know how to do anything but the "Skills" list I will give you.
I need you to help me by choosing what skills I will use to accomplish a single new task.
Don't worry about trying to do a bunch at once, I only need one little step such as obtaining a material, crafting an item or killing a mob, etc, I'll be back for more steps later.
Please follow these rules when selecting skills:
1) I have the "Skills" list but don't know which skills I need to accomplish a new task.
2) I don't want skills I won't use, but also can't do anything I don't have the skill for.
3) I can only use blocks or items I already know how to obtain from the "Skills" list.
    Example: If I have a skill to obtain wood I could try crafting wooden planks.
    Note: Please remember the minecraft recipes including quantities of each ingredient and tool needed.
4) Please do not make my new thing too difficult or too many steps, or I will get confused and be unable to complete it.
5) My new thing should be a single task with very few steps and a plain simple outcome. You should be able to describe this task in one sentence.
6) Only select skills that are absolutely necessary to the task.
7) Some skills include other skills, so only select the most advanced skill that you need, and you can ignore the simpler ones.
8) Do not feel like you have to return every skill you are given, I want you to be picky about what skills you think you need.
9) If a skill in the "Skills" list is an "internal_skill" for another skill, do not select the internal skill please.
You should return your answer in the following format:
{
    "task_name": "..."
    "skill_list": ["skill1", "skill2", ...]
}
