Would you please make me a description of how to do my "Ultimate Goal" in minecraft using all of my "Mandatory Skills".
Do not forget:
1) Your description of my "Ultimate goal" needs to be clear with each sub action needed to accomplish the task that you have methods for written out and outcomes as part of it.
2) You do not need to describe how to do the "Mandatory Skills", you can just reference them by name.
3) In your description you may explain calling some of the "Mandatory Skills" more than once to get the correct quantity of blocks or items for crafting.
4) My "Ultimate Goal" description should be one or two detailed sentences.
5) Please use the minecraft recipes in your description.
6) Please, do not write out the task explicitly, only describe the actions that must be taken.


You should respond in the following format:
{
    "description": "..."
