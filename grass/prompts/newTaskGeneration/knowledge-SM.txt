Your description must adhere to the following rules.
1) Steps should be very incremental in difficulty, based on the learning progress shown in "Mandatory Skills".
2) Your description should clear, and specific.
3) You must use your "Mandatory Skills" in the description of your new task.
4) Assume the reader is only capable of doing what is given in the "Mandatory Skills", and can do nothing else.
5) Only describe using "Mandatory Skills" the new single step task.
6) Combine your "Mandatory Skills" in a new way that is not too difficult for someone only capable of doing these "Mandatory Skills".
7) Your description should include specific minimum quantities of all materials, items, and tools necessary to complete the new task.
8) Do not name the task or define the goal, only describe the actions that must be taken.
9) Do not write a description for a task that accomplishes the same things as anything in the "Previous Descriptions" list.

You should respond in the following format:
{
    "description": "..."
}
