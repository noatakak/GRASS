The kill mob method takes in bot, the name of the mob that the agent will be attacking,
and the timeout which is initially set to 300 and represents the period of time the
agent will attempt the task. This skill can used for both hostile mobs and animals
within the game. Example: Kill a pig and collect the dropped item: killMob(bot, "pig", 300);
