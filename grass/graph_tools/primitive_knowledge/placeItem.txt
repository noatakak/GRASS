The placeItem method takes in bot, the name of the block that is
going to be  placed, and the position in the form of vec3.
The code will find a place to put the block, equip it and then set
it down.
Example: Place a crafting_table near the player, Vec3(1, 0, 0) is
just an example, you shouldn't always use that: placeItem(bot, "crafting_table", bot.entity.position.offset(1, 0, 0));
