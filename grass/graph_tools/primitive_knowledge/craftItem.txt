The craftItem function takes in bot, along with the name of the item we are looking to craft, along with the count
referring to the quantity of the specified item you would like to craft.
A crafting table must be placed before calling this function.
The method will find the crafting table, get the recipe for the item
and craft that quantity. For Example: Craft 8 oak_planks from 2 oak_log (do the recipe 2 times):
 craftItem(bot, "oak_planks", 2);
