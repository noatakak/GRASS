The craftItem function takes in bot, along with the name of the item we are looking to craft, along with the count
referring to the quantity of the specified item you would like to craft.
If the item you want to craft can be done without a crafting table, this method can be called on its own.
If the item you want to craft does require a crafting table, one must be placed, before this method can be called.
For Example: Craft 8 oak_planks from 2 oak_log (do the recipe 2 times):
 craftItem(bot, "oak_planks", 2);
